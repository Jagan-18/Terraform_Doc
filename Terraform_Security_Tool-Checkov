# 🔎 Checkov – Security Tool for IaC:
### ✅ What it is

* **Open-source static code analysis tool**.
* Built by **Bridgecrew / Prisma Cloud (Palo Alto Networks)**.
* Specially designed for **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**.
---
### ✅ What it does
* Scans your **Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, Helm, ARM, Serverless** code.
* Finds **security, compliance, and best-practice misconfigurations** *before* you deploy.
* Example checks:

  * Is an **S3 bucket public**?
  * Does an **EC2 instance have encryption enabled**?
  * Does a **Kubernetes pod run as root**?
  * Is a **security group open to 0.0.0.0/0**?
---
### ✅ Why it is important:
* **Shift-left security** → catch issues early (in dev/CI/CD), not after deployment.
* Enforces **compliance frameworks** (CIS, NIST, PCI-DSS, HIPAA).
* Reduces risk of **data leaks, misconfigured networks, or insecure defaults**.
* Automates security checks across multiple environments.
---
### ✅ Where it fits in workflow:
1. **Developer laptop** → Run `checkov -d .` before pushing code.
2. **Pre-commit hooks** → block insecure commits.
3. **CI/CD pipelines (GitLab/GitHub/Jenkins)** → scan every PR/MR.
4. **Terraform plan scanning** → validate real execution plan.
5. **Production approvals** → only secure plans get deployed.
---
### ✅ Typical Commands:
```bash
# Scan Terraform directory
checkov -d ./terraform

# Scan Terraform plan
terraform init
terraform plan -out=tfplan.binary
terraform show -json tfplan.binary > tfplan.json
checkov -f tfplan.json

# Skip a specific check in code
# checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_20: Public S3 bucket needed for static website
```
---
### ✅ Outputs:
* CLI readable output (pass/fail checks).
* JSON, JUnit, SARIF (for GitLab/GitHub code scanning).
* Can integrate into dashboards (Bridgecrew/Prisma Cloud).
---
### ✅ End-to-End Flow (simple view):
```
Developer → Write IaC → Run Checkov locally → Push to GitLab
    ↓
GitLab CI → Checkov job scans code/plan
    ↓
Fail pipeline if high-severity issues
    ↓
After approval → Terraform apply → Secure infrastructure
```
---
👉 In short:
**Checkov = IaC security guard.**
It makes sure your Terraform/K8s/Cloud configs are **secure, compliant, and safe** *before* you deploy them to AWS, Azure, GCP, or Kubernetes.

---
# What Checkov is (quick):
Checkov is an open-source static analysis tool that scans Infrastructure-as-Code files (Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, etc.) for security & compliance issues (it ships with hundreds of built-in checks). ([Checkov][1])

---
# End → End Flow (phases + concrete commands / examples):
## 1) Governance: policy requirements → map to checks

* Decide which controls must be automated (e.g., “no public S3 buckets”, “no wide security group CIDRs”, encryption required).
* Map company controls to Checkov built-in checks or plan to write **custom policies** if a rule is unique to your org. (You can author custom policies in Python or YAML.) ([Checkov][2])

---
## 2) Developer workstation (shift left):
* **Install Checkov** locally (pip/homebrew):

  ```bash
  pip install checkov
  # or
  brew install checkov
  ```

  Run quick scan locally: `checkov -d ./path/to/terraform` (or `checkov --file file.tf`). ([Checkov][3])

* Add a **pre-commit** hook so devs get fast feedback before pushing: Checkov supports pre-commit integration (add it to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`). This shifts findings left and reduces noisy MR failures. ([Checkov][4])

---
## 3) CI: static IaC scan (on MR/push):
* Run Checkov inside your CI job to fail/flag insecure IaC before merge. Typical CLI for scanning repo files:

  ```bash
  checkov -d . --output json --output-file-path checkov.json
  ```
* You can control pass/fail behavior with `--soft-fail` / `--hard-fail-on` / `--soft-fail-on` to tune what severity or checks fail the pipeline. ([Checkov][5])

**Example (GitLab job - static scan)**

```yaml
stages:
  - security
checkov_scan:
  image: python:3.10-slim
  stage: security
  script:
    - pip install checkov
    - checkov -d . --output sarif --output-file-path checkov.sarif
  artifacts:
    paths: ["checkov.sarif"]
    reports:
      codequality: checkov.sarif   # optional: integrate into MR (GitLab code scanning)
  only:
    - merge_requests
```

(Use GitLab CI variables for any secrets or provider credentials.) ([Checkov][6])

---
## 4) CI: Terraform *plan* scanning (recommended):
Static HCL checks are great, but scanning the **terraform plan** lets you validate the actual changes that will be applied (detects drift or provider-calculated values). Typical flow:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan -out=tfplan.binary
terraform show -json tfplan.binary | jq > tfplan.json   # jq formats the JSON
checkov -f tfplan.json
```

That scans the plan JSON and reports only what will change (very useful for MR-level blocking). ([Checkov][7])

**Example (GitLab job - plan scan)**

```yaml
checkov_plan:
  image: hashicorp/terraform:1.5.0
  stage: security
  before_script:
    - apk add --no-cache jq python3 py3-pip
    - pip3 install checkov
  script:
    - terraform init
    - terraform plan -out=tfplan.binary
    - terraform show -json tfplan.binary | jq > tfplan.json
    - checkov -f tfplan.json --output json --output-file-path checkov-plan.json
  artifacts:
    paths: ["checkov-plan.json"]
  only:
    - merge_requests
```

(You might use a separate runner image that has both Terraform and Python available.) ([Checkov][7])

---
## 5) Policy management & customization:
* **Built-in checks** cover many vendors; for company-specific rules create **custom policies** in Python or YAML and reuse them across repos. Checkov supports YAML and Python custom policies and a sharing mechanism. ([Checkov][2])
* Load custom checks from a local folder or remote git repo at runtime using flags like `--external-checks-dir` or `--external-checks-git`. This makes it easy to centralize policy code. ([Checkov][8])

**Example (local custom checks dir):**

```bash
checkov -d . --external-checks-dir ./my_checks
```

---
## 6) False positives, baselining, and suppressions:
* For accepted/legacy issues you don’t want to block now, use:

  * **Inline suppression** in Terraform: `# checkov:skip=CKV_AWS_20:reason` inside the resource block. ([Checkov][9])
  * **Baseline file**: create `.checkov.baseline` once with `--create-baseline` and then use `--baseline` on subsequent runs so existing noise is ignored and you only see *new* failures. ([Checkov][8])

---
## 7) Reporting, artifacts, triage & remediation:
* Checkov can emit CLI, **JSON**, **JUnit XML**, **SARIF**, **CSV**, etc. Use SARIF to feed code-scanning UI or other tools; use JSON/JUnit for dashboards & failing pipelines. ([GitHub][10])
* The output includes check IDs (e.g., `CKV_AWS_20`) and remediation hints. Use those IDs to track tickets, add owners, and measure MTTR.

---
## 8) Enforcement and release gating:
* Enforce checks at MR level (block merges) for high severity checks; allow soft-fail for low severity while teams remediate. Use `--hard-fail-on` to make certain checks non-negotiable. ([Checkov][5])
* For Prod deployments, require an explicit approval step after plan scan passes (manual job or protected branch rules in GitLab).

---
## 9) Centralized scanning & platform integrations:
* If you need organization-wide visibility, Checkov integrates with Bridgecrew / Prisma Cloud for central dashboards, MR annotations, and policy management (API keys, platform rules). The CLI can also upload logs / be used with a platform back end for aggregated reporting and policy enforcement. (If you use the Bridgecrew platform, you’ll get additional features like enrichment & suggested fixes.) ([GitHub][10])

---
## 10) Operational hardening (best practices checklist):
* Run Checkov locally (pre-commit) + in CI (MR static + plan scan). ([Checkov][4])
* Use separate credentials/variables for CI (never hardcode).
* Keep custom policies in a central repo and reference via `--external-checks-git` in CI for consistent enforcement. ([Checkov][11])
* Use baseline and inline suppressions sparingly & track them in a ticketing system. ([Checkov][8])
* Fail fast for HIGH severity; soft-fail for LOW until fixed. ([Checkov][5])

---
# Quick command summary (copy-paste):
* Local scan: `checkov -d ./infra` ([Checkov][3])
* Plan scan:

  ````bash
  terraform init
  terraform plan -out=tfplan.binary
  terraform show -json tfplan.binary | jq > tfplan.json
  checkov -f tfplan.json
  ``` :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}
  ````
* Create baseline: `checkov -d . --create-baseline` → future runs: `checkov -d . --baseline .checkov.baseline`. ([Checkov][8])
* Load external checks from git: `checkov -d . --external-checks-git https://github.com/my-org/custom-checks.git` ([Checkov][11])

---
# Want a ready-to-paste `.gitlab-ci.yml` with these patterns?
I already included two compact job examples above (static scan, plan scan). If you’d like, I can **generate a full, production-ready GitLab CI pipeline** that includes:

* secure variable usage (Terraform & cloud creds),
* a two-job flow (plan + checkov plan scan),
* SARIF output artifact and MR gating,
* and a separate job to apply **only** after manual approval.

Tell me whether you want the pipeline to run on (A) **plan-scan + check only**, or (B) **plan + apply (protected)** — I’ll generate the full YAML.
