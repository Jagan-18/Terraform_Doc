# Terraform Configuration: Key Notes & Guide
**1. What Is a Terraform Configuration?**
A Terraform configuration is a collection of files (usually with the .tf extension) written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). These files define the desired state of your infrastructure—what resources you want, how they should behave, and which provider to use.

**2. Structure of a Configuration**
A basic configuration typically includes:
**1. Provider Block:** Specifies the cloud or service you’re managing.
**2. Resource Block:** Declares what you want to create/manage.
**3. Variables & Outputs:** (Optional) Make your config flexible and reusable.

## Example Structure:
```
  provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
 }

 resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "my-terraform-bucket"
  acl    = "private"
 }

 output "bucket_name" {
  value = aws_s3_bucket.example.bucket
 }

```

**3. Provider Block:**
- Tells Terraform which platform to interact with.
- Must be configured in every main config file.
```
 provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
 }

```

**4. Resource Block:**
- Declares infrastructure objects.
- Each resource has a type (e.g., aws_instance), a name, and configuration parameters.


```
 resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
 }
```

**5. Variables and Outputs:**
Variables and outputs add modularity and flexibility.

```
 variable "instance_type" {
  default = "t2.micro"
 }
```
Use the variable in your resource:

instance_type = var.instance_type

### Outputs:
```
output "instance_id" {
  value = aws_instance.web_server.id
}
```

**6. Initialization and Workflow Steps:**
After you write your configuration:

1. Initialize the project
 - Run: terraform init
2. Check the plan
 - Run: terraform plan
3. Apply changes
 - Run: terraform apply
4. Review or update as needed
 - Edit your .tf files and repeat the workflow.


**7. Organizing Your Configurations:**
1. **main.tf** – Main resources and providers
2. **variables.tf** – Variable definitions
3. **outputs.tf** – Output definitions
4. **terraform.tfvars** – Variable values (can be kept secret)

Tip: For large projects, split content across multiple files for readability and reuse.

**8. Practical Example: Deploying an EC2 Instance on AWS:**
```
 provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
 }

 resource "aws_instance" "my_ec2" {
  ami           = "ami-0c94855ba95c71c99"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "MyEC2Instance"
  }
 }

 output "instance_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.my_ec2.public_ip
 }
```

#### Summary:
Terraform configuration files let you declare your infrastructure in a simple, readable language. Mastering configs is the gateway to automating deployments, reducing manual errors, and improving your DevOps workflow.
